* Exporting duplis with RENDER settings instead if PREVIEW (allowing the display percentage to work as intended).

3.8.5.0
--------
* Added arch glass option to specular material.
* Fixed particle export being slow.
* Fixed background rotation.
* Fixed parent visibility being ignored.
* When exporting animations, frames have a random seed, seeded by frame number.

3.6.28.0
--------

3.6.17.0
--------
* Showing an error message if Indigo executable is not found when exporting and rendering.
* Added shadow catcher option for diffuse material.
* Added support for invisible_to_camera object attribute.
* Added sharing of meshes for animation export.
* Fixed skip_existing_meshes
* Fixed bug: Material name is not detected correctly for external material sometimes.

3.6.11.0
--------
* Fixed issue with object in edit mode not being exported.
* write_igmesh() now always writes at least one UV (to stop Indigo from complaining about meshes without UVs using textures).
* Added Absorption channel to coating material.
* Exposure is now a float value to allow exposure > 1s (unfortunately resets exposure back to 125 in exising scenes).

3.6.10.0
--------
* Added Transmittance channel to double-sided thin material.
* Hemi lamp now supports both Spherical and Spherical Environment types.

3.6.5.1
-------
* Added basic support for coating material.
* Added basic support for double-sided thin material.
* Added sphere primitive (Checkbox in Indigo Object Settings in Object Data)

3.4.9.4
-------
* Specular material 'transparent' defaults to true.
* Specular material default IOR is now 1.5.
* Fixed external materials that were broken in 3.4.9.3

3.4.9.3
-------
* Installer now installs into Blender 2.6.4 directory scripts directory instead of 2.6.3.

3.4.9.2
-------
* Changed section plane support to use custom object properties instead of '.section' magic naming.
* Added 'cull geometry' option as well.
* Fixed crashes and errors during animation export.
* Fixed export IGMesh command.

3.4.9.1
-------
* Added section plane support (use by creating a plane with name ending with '.section')
* Added orthographic camera support.

3.4.8.2
-------
* Fixed overriding of path to Indigo executable every time on startup.

3.4.8.1
-------
* If there is no light in the scene, a white environment light is exported.
* Fixed only first material assigned to object getting its IES profile and emission scale exported.
* Fixed bug with IES paths being incorrect.
* Hopefully fixed bug with motion blur keyframes having wrong rotation.

3.4.7.1
-------
Fixed bug with shading normals and proxies that would cause export to fail.

3.2.14.2
--------
* Mesh export is a lot faster (~3x faster)
* Changed the way UVs are exported.
* Indigo 3.4.6 is now required.
